\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
\IEEEPARstart{M}{achine} vision is an important part of the interdisciplinary field of robotics. Developers of programming systems in general and machine vision software in particular face the challenge of bringing together
\begin{itemize}
  \item performance
  \item productivity
  \item generality
\end{itemize}
in a single architecture (see \fig{triangle}).
\begin{figure}[!t]
   \begin{center}
     \resizebox{.5\columnwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{triangle}}\\
     \caption{The main requirements when designing a programming language or system \citep{wolczko2011}\label{fig:triangle}}
   \end{center}
\end{figure}

Scripting languages offer a great productivity advantage and the productivity of programmer's measured in \ac{LOC} per hour seems to be independent of the programming language\citep{prechelt2000empirical}. However performance is critical when implementing a machine vision system. \emph{I.e.} when prototyping a machine vision system using a scripting language such as Octave (productivity \& generality), it is usually necessary to later port it to a compiled language such as C/C++ (performance \& generality) to implement the final system.

Today's desktop software is dominated by complex software systems which cannot be understood by a single person any more. However most of this complexity can be shown to be "accidental" rather than inherent\citep{ohshima2013kscript}. Using \acp{DSL}, one can keep the size of software systems (measured in LOC) \emph{orders of magnitudes} smaller and thus more manageable\citep{kay2010steps}.

In this paper we are going to show how the Ruby programming language (which has strong support for DSLs) can help to reduce accidental complexity when implementing real-time machine vision software.

\section{Ruby Programming Language}
The Ruby programming language\footnote{\url{http://www.ruby-lang.org/}} is an \emph{interpreted language}. It uses a \emph{mark-and-sweep} garbage collector for memory management. Important features of the programming language are
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{late binding}
  \item \emph{closures}
  \item \emph{exception handling}
  \item \emph{continuations}
  \item \emph{open classes}
\end{itemize}

Ruby has support for \emph{meta-programming}. In particular
\begin{itemize}
  \item \code{methods} returns an object's list of available methods
  \item \code{define\_method} defines a method at runtime
  \item \code{method\_missing} traps calls to nonexistent methods
  \item \code{send} dynamically calls a method
\end{itemize}

% empirical evidence for productivity (LOC, structural complexity)
% theoretical contribution: generic operations, more fundamental understanding of computer vision

% Ruby: Interactive Ruby, inspect, coerce, numerical library, unit testing, (Const.new)
% MRI: single threaded (JRuby?, Rubinius?), meta-programming does not cover control statements (while, if, ...)

% Closures $\Rightarrow$ custom control structures! (video input)

% No architecture: don't impose a static datatype for representing images etc

% Integration

% JIT compilation (using GCC): fetch, construct, store, coerce, coercion, descriptor, dup,
% compilable?, strip, get, assign, write, storage\_size, memory\_type, default, inspect

% fast development cycle

% maximally generic (binary operations (no subset of integer types), histograms, tensor operations, luts/warps, map (unary operation), inject, mask/unmask (larrabee), integral, convolution)

% Possible topics for papers submitted to the journal include but
% are not limited to:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Analysis of issues and challenges in the development of robot software systems, that make the robotic domain similar/different to other application domains (e.g. automotive, factory automation)
%     \item Identification of recurrent concepts, aspects, and requirements in robot software systems, that may lead to the definition of standard / common / unified specifications, design models, interfaces, protocols, and software libraries
%     \item Documentation of measures and procedures to evaluate software quality factors
%     \item Description of conceptual tools as well as software environments that simplify the design, implementation, and reuse of robot software systems.
%     \item Exploitation of software engineering conceptual tools (e.g. formal specification and verification methods) to cope with specific robotic requirements (e.g. fault tolerance, robustness, autonomy, real-time guarantee)
%     \item Experience reports and case studies of successful development of software systems for real robotic applications.

% \section{Editorial Policies}
% This journal provides immediate open access to its content on the
% principle that making research freely available to the public
% supports a greater global exchange of knowledge.
% Papers will be available on the JOSER Web portal as soon as they have been approved by the
% reviewers.
%
% \subsection{Type of papers}
% Submitted articles may be of three basic types:
%
% {\bf Regular papers}: Detailed discussion involving new
% research, applications or developments. There is no length limit
% on regular papers. The nominal length is 10 single-spaced, double
% column pages including figures and bibliography. However, it is
% recommended that papers not exceed 15 single-spaced, double column
% pages. Papers that exceed this recommended maximum length will
% still be considered, but might not be guaranteed editorial review
% or publication in a timely fashion.
%
% {\bf Short papers}: Brief presentations of new technical concepts
% and developments. Short papers should not exceed 6 single-spaced
% double column pages including figures and bibliography.
%
% {\bf Comments}: Comments are brief contributions that comment on
% previously published papers. These may include reports on
%
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item exploitation and validation of research results
%     \item interpretation of experimental data
%     \item opinions about open issues
% \end{itemize}
% Comments should equal 4 single-spaced double column pages (including reasonably sized figures and references).


%\subsection{Review criteria}
%Papers are reviewed and evaluated according to the following criteria.
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Relevance. Descriptions of pure sensor processing, planning or control get a lower score than documentations of (1) software architectures that help to integrate these core aspects of robotics, (2) software requirements that have been taken into account (portability, reusability, maintainability, interoperability, etc.), (3) metrics and methods that allow to assess software quality factors of robotic systems, or (4) computational issues related to the implementation of robotics algorithms. Papers should report on what was learned in doing the work, rather than merely on what was done.
\section{$\ldots$}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Software architecture based on memory objects (Malloc) allows integration (no C++ "static" types).
  \item Requirements: generic operators on n-dimensional arrays, high performance, binary operations on any element-type (including array), generic operators instead of monolithic implementations
  \item Ruby allows for functional testing
  \item Using closures during camera initialisation and for displaying videos
\end{itemize}
%    \item Significance. Descriptions of ad-hoc software library, framework, or middleware for specific robotic systems get a lower score that documentation of reuse/adaptation/reengineering of existing software artifacts. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to demonstrate the utility of their work on significant problems; any experiments reported should be     reproducible. Contributions to relevant standards, benchmarks, software patterns as well as their adoption in novel application contexts are positively evaluated.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Integration of existing I/O libraries: ALSA, DC1394, FFMpeg, Kinect, OpenEXR, Qt4, RMagick, V4L2, Xorg
  \item Integration with other libraries: FFTW3, libswscale, linalg, narray, opencv
  \item Utility of the work: TODO
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
% Typical functions of the conclusion of a scientific paper include 1)
% summing up, 2) a statement of conclusions, 3) a statement of
% recommendations, and 4) a graceful termination. Any one of these, or
% any combination, may be appropriate for a particular paper. Some
% papers do not need a separate concluding section, particularly if
% the conclusions have already been stated in the introduction.
Clojure, Factor, STEPS project

%    \item Originality. The work cannot have been published previously or be pending publication in another journal, and submissions cannot be under review or be sent for review in any other journal. We will consider research that has been published, or is under consideration for publication at workshops or conferences. In these cases, we expect the JMLR submission to go into greater depth and extend the published results in a substantive way. Authors must notify JOSER about previous or pending conference publication at the time of submission.
%    \item Technical quality. Use of standard modeling languages (e.g. UML, SysML, Marte, AADL) is positively evaluated as well as motivation why existing standards are not sufficient for the authors’ purpose. All claims should be clearly articulated and supported either by empirical experiments or theoretical analyses.
%    \item Presentation. Papers must be concise and complete; manuscripts should be carefully proofread and polished. Submissions that do not meet these criteria may be returned unreviewed.
%\end{itemize}

%\section{Manuscript submission}
%Authors need to register with the journal prior to submitting, or if already registered can
%simply log in and begin the 5 step process.
%All submissions are acknowledged.
